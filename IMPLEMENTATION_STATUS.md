## 📋 Next Steps: Operational Testing

### 1. Prepare Alarm Sound File (Important!)

Currently, `assets/alarm_sound.mp3` contains a system AIFF file.
If you want to use a better alarm sound, replace it with the following steps:

```bash
# Place MP3 file as assets/alarm_sound.mp3
cp your_alarm_sound.mp3 /Users/apple/work/zap_clock/assets/alarm_sound.mp3
```

**Recommended sound file specifications:**
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 10-30 seconds
- Volume: Moderate volume (played at 0.8x in the app)

**Free sound resource sites:**
- [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/)
- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

### 2. Build and Test

```bash
cd /Users/apple/work/zap_clock

# Build
fvm flutter build apk --debug

# Or run directly on device/emulator
fvm flutter run
```

## 🚀 Phase 2: Lightning Payment Feature (Not Implemented)

To be implemented in the next phase:

### Planned Features

   - Rust + flutter_rust_bridge
   - Use rust-nostr library
   - NWC connection settings screen

2. **Lightning Payment Feature**
   - Lightning address to LNURL-pay conversion
   - Invoice retrieval
   - Payment processing via NWC
   - Stop alarm after successful payment

3. **Add Settings Screen**
   - NWC connection string input
   - Lightning address setting
   - Payment amount (sats) setting

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network error handling
   - Payment failure handling
   - NWC connection error handling

### Architecture Proposal

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Used Packages

- **flutter_riverpod**: ^2.6.1 - State management
- **alarm**: ^5.1.5 - Alarm functionality
- **shared_preferences**: ^2.3.5 - Local storage
- **go_router**: ^14.6.4 - Routing
- **permission_handler**: ^11.3.1 - Permission management
- **intl**: ^0.20.1 - Date/time formatting

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Reasons for Adopting alarm Package**
   - Built-in screen unlock functionality
   - Audio playback and vibration support
   - Background operation
   - Simple API

2. **Using Riverpod 2.x**
   - Follows latest syntax and best practices
   - Use Consumer only (ConsumerWidget prohibited)
   - Separation of UI and logic

3. **MVP Approach**
   - Repository layer not implemented (add when needed)
   - Simple and maintainable code
   - Gradual feature additions

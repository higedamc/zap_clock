# ZapStore Release Guide ‚ö°

This document explains the procedure for publishing ZapClock on ZapStore.

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Prepare Nostr Account

- **Nostr private/public keys**: Used as developer account
- **Recommended clients**: 
  - [Alby](https://getalby.com/) - Browser extension
  - [Damus](https://damus.io/) - iOS
  - [Amethyst](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst) - Android

### 2. Required Tools

```bash
# flutter_rust_bridge_codegen
cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen

# cargo-ndk (for Rust build on Android)
cargo install cargo-ndk

# ZapStore CLI (may be needed in the future)
# npm install -g @zapstore/cli
```

---

## üöÄ Release Procedure

### Step 1: Build the Application

#### 1.1 Build Rust Code

```bash
cd /Users/apple/work/zap_clock/rust

# Build for Android
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -o ../android/app/src/main/jniLibs build --release
cargo ndk -t armeabi-v7a -o ../android/app/src/main/jniLibs build --release
cargo ndk -t x86_64 -o ../android/app/src/main/jniLibs build --release
```

#### 1.2 Build Flutter APK

```bash
cd /Users/apple/work/zap_clock

# Release build
fvm flutter build apk --release

# Or optimize size with split-per-abi
fvm flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

The built APK will be located at:
```
build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

#### 1.3 Get APK Hash Value

```bash
# Calculate SHA256 hash
sha256sum build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Or
openssl dgst -sha256 build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

Record this hash value in `zapstore.yaml`.

### Step 2: Prepare Screenshots

Take screenshots and place them in the `screenshots/` directory.

For details, refer to [`screenshots/README.md`](screenshots/README.md).

Required screenshots:
- ‚úÖ `01_alarm_list.png` - Alarm list

  repository: "https://github.com/yourusername/zap_clock"
  license: "MIT"

# Platform information
platforms:
  android:
    minSdkVersion: 23
    targetSdkVersion: 34
    apk: "build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### APK Build Error

**Problem**: Rust library not linked

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check jniLibs directory
ls -la android/app/src/main/jniLibs/

# Rebuild if necessary
cd rust
./build.sh
```

### App Not Found in ZapStore

**Cause**:
- Nostr event not propagated to relay
- Duplicate `identifier`
- Incomplete metadata

**Solution**:
- Use multiple Nostr relays
- Make `identifier` in `zapstore.yaml` unique
- Contact ZapStore support

### App Won't Launch After Installation

**Cause**:
- Required permissions not declared
- Rust library not built correctly

**Solution**:
- Verify permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Check error logs with `adb logcat`
- Rebuild Rust code

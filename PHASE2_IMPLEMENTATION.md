## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Basic Alarm (No Lightning Settings)

1. Tap the "+" button on the alarm list screen
2. Set time and label
3. Tap "Save"
4. When alarm rings, tap "Stop Alarm" to silence it

### 2. Alarm Requiring Lightning Payment

#### Prerequisites
1. Prepare an NWC-compatible wallet (Alby, Mutiny, etc.)
2. Obtain NWC connection string

#### Setup Steps
1. Tap the ⚙️ (Settings) button in the top right
2. Enter connection string in "Nostr Wallet Connect" section
3. Test connection with "Test Connection" (optional)
4. Enter Lightning settings in alarm edit screen
   - NWC connection string
   - Lightning address (e.g., `user@getalby.com`)
   - Payment amount (sats)
5. Tap "Save"

#### Stopping the Alarm
1. Alarm rings
2. Payment information is displayed
3. Tap "Pay to Stop Alarm" button
4. Processing payment... (loading display)
5. Payment success → Alarm stops
6. Payment failure → Error display, alarm continues ringing

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Rust Bridge Not Generated

Currently, Rust code is implemented but bridge code generation via `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` has not been performed.

**Therefore, Lightning payment functionality operates with "mock implementation".**

#### Mock Implementation Behavior
- `NwcService.testConnection()` → Waits 1 second, returns "Connection successful (mock)"
- `NwcService.payInvoice()` → Waits 2 seconds, returns dummy payment_hash
- No actual Nostr communication or Lightning payment occurs

### To Use in Production

The following steps are required to generate the Rust bridge:

```bash
# 1. Install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen
cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen

# 2. Run build script
cd /Users/apple/work/zap_clock/rust
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

# 3. Android build (requires cargo-ndk)
cargo install cargo-ndk
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -o ../android/app/src/main/jniLibs build --release

# 4. Build Flutter app
cd /Users/apple/work/zap_clock
fvm flutter build apk --release
```

## 🧪 Test Items

### Basic Features (Can be verified with mock implementation)
- [ ] Settings screen displays
- [ ] Can enter NWC connection string
- [ ] "Test Connection" button displays mock success message
- [ ] Lightning settings fields display in alarm edit screen
- [ ] Can enter Lightning settings and save alarm
- [ ] Alarm with Lightning settings rings
- [ ] Payment information displays
- [ ] Pressing "Pay to Stop Alarm" button shows loading display
- [ ] Payment succeeds after 2 seconds and alarm stops

### Tests After Rust Bridge Generation

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Rust Bridge Generation and Device Testing

Follow the steps above to build Rust code and test actual NWC/Lightning payments.

### 2. UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] Payment history display
- [ ] Multiple NWC connection profile management
- [ ] Different payment recipients per alarm

### 3. Security Enhancement

- [ ] Encrypted storage of NWC connection strings (flutter_secure_storage)
- [ ] Biometric authentication for payments
- [ ] Payment amount limit settings

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

- [ ] Retry functionality for network errors
- [ ] Nostr relay connection redundancy
- [ ] Timeout settings

## 💡 Development Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Optional Settings**
   - All Lightning settings (NWC, address, amount) are optional
   - Payment required only when all three are set
   - Prioritizes flexibility

2. **Behavior on Payment Failure**
   - Alarm continues ringing on payment failure
   - Preserves "pay to wake up" concept
   - Gives user chance to retry

3. **Adopting Mock Implementation**
   - UI functionality can be verified before Rust bridge generation
   - Enables phased development
   - Easy to test

---

## 🎉 Summary

With Phase 2 implementation, ZapClock has become **the world's first alarm app that stops with Lightning payments**!

**Current Status:** UI and logic complete, operational verification possible with mock implementation
**Next:** Generate Rust bridge to enable actual payment functionality

A unique and practical application deeply integrated into the Bitcoin/Nostr ecosystem.
